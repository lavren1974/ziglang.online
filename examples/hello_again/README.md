```zig

const print = @import("std").debug.print;

}

```

```
$ zig build-exe hello_again.zig

$ ./hello_again
Hello, world!
```

This code is another simple "Hello, world!" program written in the Zig programming language, but it's a more concise version compared to the previous example. Let's break it down line by line:

`const print = @import("std").debug.print;`

This line imports the standard library using the `@import` keyword and directly accesses the `debug.print` function from the `std` namespace. The `debug.print` function is then assigned to the constant identifier `print`. The `debug.print` function is a simple, non-buffered print function that writes directly to the standard error stream (stderr).

`pub fn main() void {`

This line defines the entry point of the program, the `main` function, which is public (`pub`) and has a return type of `void`. The `void` type indicates that the main function does not return any value or error.

`print("Hello, world!\n", .{});`

This line uses the `print` function (an alias for `std.debug.print`) to print the string "Hello, world!" followed by a newline character to the stderr. The `print` function takes a format string and a tuple of arguments. In this case, the format string is `"Hello, world!\n"` and the tuple of arguments is an empty anonymous struct `.{}`, because there are no placeholders in the format string to be replaced by any values.

`}`

This line simply closes the main function's block of code.

When this program is executed, it will print "Hello, world!" followed by a newline character to the console. Note that unlike the previous example, this version of the program does not handle I/O errors as it uses the `debug.print` function, which doesn't return errors.
